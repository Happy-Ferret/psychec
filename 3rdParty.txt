- The parser we use, located in directory `parser', is the C++ parser from the Qt Creator
  IDE. We have extended/modified it for ambiguity handling and for C-specific features.

- The command-line processing component, located in directory `command', is written by
  Jarryd Beck and it's originally from https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts.
