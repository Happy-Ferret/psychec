-- Specification of type conversion rules

module Solver.ConversionRules where

import Data.Type
import Data.BuiltIn

convertible :: Ty -> Ty -> Bool
convertible t t' =
    or [ t == t'
       -- Arithmetic types convert among themselves.
       , and [isArithTy t, isArithTy t']

       -- Enumerators are fundamentally integers.
       , and [isArithTy t, isEnum t']
       , and [isEnum t, isArithTy t']

       , or [t == PtrTy (QualTy void), t' == PtrTy (QualTy void)]

       -- Attention: The scalar-type lattice prevents overunification issues
       -- by dropping inconsistent constraints between pointers and arithmetic
       -- types. But it's not yet working inter-procedurally by matching
       -- formals x arguments. We'll eventually remove the conversions below.
       -- Even though we found real programs relying on it.
